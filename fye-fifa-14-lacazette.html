                            <p>Mine was IF Tarrabt in Fifa 13. Guy was a monster, with 5 star skills Going to post result after each pack. Im doing this since i dont have fun playing FUT anymore and switching to career. Well if i pack TOTW Messi then. 1. Zaza + 1000 coins boost. 2. Fernandinho 86 :D 3. Felipe Anderson 4. Thauvin 84, Shadow 5. Rashford 81 6. Verdi 81, 1000 coin boost and lol Contract pack 7. Diego Lopez 80 8. Barzagli 84, Depay 83 9. Herelle 76 10. Bernandeschi 82 11. Guaita 81 12. Škrtel 81 13. Pepe 84 TOTW, i saw white logo and totw it got me i thought someth. Last week I created a survey to gauge opinions and to see where people are with this years Fifa. The response I got was honestly fantastic, over 10000 people answered the survey! So without further ado, lets get into the results. What Division are you in? Division 5 - 49.8% of people Division 4 - 26.2% of people Division 6 - 11.8% of people Division 3 - 8% of people Division 2 - 1.3% of people Division 1 - 1% of people Division 7/Division 10 - 0.9% of people Division. I used to love playing with Benzema, scored some amazing goals in past fifas. But this time around he's lazy on the ball, gives away possession, shoots wide from inside the box, just cannot get my head around it. He's scored like 14 goals in 27 matches and thats abysmal for his 86 card, given my 81 Lacazette is already past 100 goals in 130 games and vardy is 60 goals So far i have done 17 of them. They are 1. Van Aanholt 2.Lukaku 3.Saracchi 4.Zakaria 5.Bruma 6. Torreira 7.Valencia 8.Kovacic 9. Rodrigo 10. Lacazette 11. Son 12. Gomez 13.Matuidi 14. Khedria 15 Firmino 16. Thiago Silva 17. Coutinho I do enjoy having these players. Makes for fun squads and as far as how many players i used or how much coins i wasted i honestly couldnt care less about that. i much rather spend my coins and what not on sbcs. Cant bring the coins with you to fifa 20. well least. Why?: I pulled UCL Live VVD in one of these packs day one. (Proof: https://i.imgur.com/EoVl13i.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/EoVl13i.jpg)). I was stunned. At this time I had about 1.2 million coins invested and I was sitting on 250k. I'm an investor/trader and my number one rule is to never get high on my own supply. I make my coins off of people who want to do these SBCs, I should not indulge. But once I pulled VVD I started to look at my club closely. I only run two teams. I want to start by saying that I'm not just out for EA, I think the principle of FUTSwap is a great one- with the play to earn (almost) aspect and having a variety of rewards, giving scaled outputs based on the relative time put in. However, every month, I look at every option and, when reflecting on the effort needed to get the cards, give an air of disappointment. In this post, I'll be looking at each item in the January FUTSwap and detailing why they do not represent good enough value 
I played this video game a long time ago. I think it was for Playstation 2. It was called NBA Street. You played 3-on-3 basketball. This game introduce me to the "Winner takes one" concept. If you beat a team, you got to keep a player from the other team to be on your team. That has always been a fascinating concept to me. It would probably be a horrible practice in real life, but it seems like a fun thing to explore. So let’s see what would happen if last season, Liverpool got to take a player. Just finished my 3rd FUT Champs Weekend and it was my best yet. Finished Gold 2 with 17 wins. I noticed I improved my game in the last few weeks which has helped dramatically. Mostly being more patient, less running and using a few skill moves to create space. My team: https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/web-app/?showoffId=YGTv7QMBnPp1d:FFA19PS4 Here are my notes from this weekend if everyone is curious. I supsect being in the U.S. reduces the severe issues with lag that everyone talks. This was just for fun. I decided to track some of my player statistics this WL. It was my second WL on FIFA 19. First one I got 17/28 wins and therefore got gold 2. This weekend the servers has been EXTREMELY (!!!) laggy. I literally got 2.0-2.5 second delay in EVERY game I played this week. None of my matches were free from delay/lag at all. Okay. So. This is the the team looks like like with full chem: https://puu.sh/C07cl/780248b954.png And this is the formation. 2017/18 Player Review Alexandre Lacazette Bit slow off the blocks for player reviews this year, same old excuses  There will be 1 review a day to squeeze in all the first team before the world cup starts.

Secondly, I have included this weekend’s fixtures to help you follow how well they do during their respective games.

I've never played more than 10 games in a WL because I just never felt like it or didn't have the time to play, only ever bothered to qualify maybe 4 times since FIFA 17 to now. Mainly just play seasons/draft at my leisure. Despite being able to handle myself as a high division player, I always thought it's just a bit too sweaty, too many games and not fun. I now feel I was right all along. I had Friday & today free this weekend so I qualified Thursday night at like 1am(to the annoyance.

After about 5 months of playing, I've finally unlocked one of the main game modes on fifa 18, and played fut champs. Here is my team: https://www.futbin.com/18/squad/4444447 I played 18 games on Friday and the rest on Saturday. And here is how it went (I put down the score and the top scorers/players on the opposing team): 1) Lost 2 - 6 (Crespo) 2) Lost 2 - 6 (Larsson 90) 3) Lost 3 - 7 (IF Aguero 91 & Salah 92) 4) Won 4 - 3 aet (G. Jesus 81) 5) Lost 3 - 4 (Aguero I’ve done an analysis of the Top Attackers in the game and then compared that to their current market price. I’ve created a score for each attacker by applying different weightings to all their in-game stats and also incorporating Weak Foot, Skills and Height. (the in-game Overall ratings is arbitrary and includes International reputation) The weightings used were discussed in a previous post I made (https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5g398a/best_attackers_in_fifa_17_a_data_driven_approac. Since I saw a comment today about player trading in FIFA 14, I've been thinking how much fun it would be. FUT is fun getting cards but as a fantasy football player it is so much more exciting when you get to trade actual players for each other. The coin market makes that useless in FIFA but I had the following idea to integrate it into the game while giving you flexibility with your untradeables (double whammy!). So the idea is: a new aspect of the market is a player for player exchange So, about a month ago I gave this guy heavenly praise for his 91 rated 4IF card on this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/663xp8/fif_91_cavani_appreciation_post/ Fast forward 4 weeks and there I was, sitting in a lecture, bored out of my mind. I decided to check up on futhead for any new players released, and it was then that I saw him. Shining in majestic purple and silver: UNFP Player of the year Cavani. About half a second later I saw a number "99" next to "SHO". I knew instantly.

Having seen the masterclass of Pep's 2-3-5 for Bayern, other managers have started to take note. The world is fascinated by this refreshing take on tactics, and slowly but surely more managers begin to put the same tactic in place. With some subtle encouragement from the FA's, excited by the idea of fast attacking football, soon the whole world is converted. Everyone is using the 2-3-5. But has the footballing scene changed for the better? Will there be the intense matches everyone craves Hey comrades, I finished the Weekend League in one sitting on Friday so let’s take a look at where things went wrong and right. There’s also a video to accompany this post, definitely check it out (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6vXA9F-gME) if that’s your kind of thing. It’s nearly 20 minutes of no filler analysis and some banter. For this post, I’ll include specific Streamable clips chopped from the video so that we can have a visual for everything we talk about. The text summarizes So this has been my first ever FIFA purchase and nearly 3.5 months completed. My best being D3, here are the kind of players I've faced so far in FUT Online Seasons. See if you can relate! 1. The Pace Abuser - 60 chem team with the fastest players in game - generally, Walcott, Aubameyang, Mane, Doumbia and you know the rest. 2. The Tiki-Taka4Lyf guy - He will keep 70% possession, perform a back pass every single time he reaches the opponents box. Rage quits when he gets scored. See EDITS from original list at the bottom. I’m a numbers kind of guy, so I thought I’d go through a data driven approach to determine the best forward’s in the game. Excuse the long post as I had to try to explain my methodology. If you don’t like reading you can just look at the ranking table. The first thing you need to be aware of is that the Overall rating of a player in FIFA is determined by how EA feels about a player overall, and does not necessarily represent how well the player. This is not a rant , Just a situation with me: So my young brother started playing Fifa lately and he was struggling with the game , So I decided to transfer 50K to his account to help him out. I got banned the other day , No warning, nothing. I know that with what I did I broke the rules and Terms Of Service. So I talked to an advisor and submitted an appeal to EA. I basically told them that I admit my mistake and that I broke your rules but that I was not selling coins , I didn't receive.
